# SequenceSnap

SequenceSnap leverages the power of ChatGPT to help TikTok users decide the order of posting photos and develop an appropriate caption for the slideshow. 
It solves the problem of TikTok users, especially influencers, taking long periods of time to curate their posts creatively. 
At times, users may struggle to come up with a meaningful story that flows naturally through the order of pictures posted and our product eliminates that.
